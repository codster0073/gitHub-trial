<h1>Top 5 Car for Minnesota</h1>

<p1 class="trial">
<b>These cars are great for anyone who is looking for a fast cool car that can put up with our minnesotan weather </b>
</p1>

<h2>Subaru-Wrx-Sti</h2>

</map>

<p>
<b>The Subaru Wrx Sti is my overall number 1 choice. I choice this mainly because I believe it has the most value per dollar. First of all it is a couple steps away from becoming the perfect rally car.
Performance wise it goes head to head with the evo lancer with 305hp. It is very mod freindly with companies such as cobb. Last of all subaru is known for its realiability.
These cars have a qaulity build behind them and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles.</b>

<h2>Mistibishu Evo Lancer</h2>

<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1024,720" href="http://www.mitsubishicars.com/lancer-evolution" target="_blank" />
</map2>

<p>
<b>My overall second choice is the Evo Lancer. This car is incredibly quick and agile. It carries the rally look of the STI and the precision handling. It is a little more expensive used
but with that comes its individuality. When put head to head with the wrx these cars are mere seconds apart
</b>
</p>

<h2>Mistibishu Eclipse</h2>

<map name="map3">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1024,720" href="http://www.edmunds.com/mitsubishi/eclipse/" target="_blank" />
</map3>

<p>
<b>My third choice was the mistibishu eclipse. This car is much more budget friendly and a very unique look. With fwd is not the best for winter weather but works.
and at half the price you have a car that is only a couple seconds behind on the quarter mile. It is very fun with a 3.0L turbo
</b>
</p>

<h2>Infiniti G35x</h2>

<img src="g35x.png" width="1024px" height="720px" border="2" usemap="#map4" />

<map name="map4">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1024,720" href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2007-infiniti-g35x-awd-short-take-road-test" target="_blank" />
</map4>

<p>
<b>Coming in 4th the infiniti G35x. This car is much more comfortable or luxury like. Yet it still has its stunning looks. It is in a much different class compared
to the rest of the cars. First of all it is much more rwd based. It will even send 100% of the power to the rear wheels during a steady speed. It is not as lightweigt
with close to 500lb extra. This car is very fun if you need a more mainstream vehicle
</b>
</p>

<h2>Audi S4</h2>

<map name="map5">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,1024,720" href="https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-s4" target="_blank" />
</map5>

<p>
<b>My final choice is the audi S4. With amazing power and handling from german engineering this is one of the most technoligically advanced cars.
This car makes 333hp from its supercharged 3.0L. This car will most certianly be the smoothest ride out of the 5. My only problem with this car is the fact that
it is a gas guzzler. On top of that maintenance can get very spendy and sometimes repairs are triple the cost of much more common brands. If you can put that aside
this is one of the nicest cars out of the 5 and will not let you performance-wise.
